# My Study Tools
A description of what study tools I use and how.

## MarginNote

To keep track of questions I didn't understand, maintain flashcards.

## Obsidian

Maintain flashcards, considering moving this fully to MarginNote.

## LiquidText

Great for annotation with pdf's etc, great for linking. Has partly the same functionality as MarginNote but is much smoother with linking etc. Will use in combination with MarginNotes.
